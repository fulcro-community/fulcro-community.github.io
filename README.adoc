Source for https://fulcro-community.github.io/ build by https://antora.org/ - see `./antora-playbook.yml`.

Whenever we push to this repo:

- the GitHub action invokes antora with the playbook, which fetches docs from this one and additional repos (guides etc)
- the site is built and pushed to the `gh-pages` branch, GH displays it.

= Site structure

The site is composed of multiple separate git repositories - "documentation modules" - included either via git submodules (where the structure of the repo is suitable for that) or explicitly.

**What modules** are there? Look into `./antora-playbook.yml` for what sources we include and then into `antora.yml` in that repo/directory; the `name:` there defines the name of the module that you can use to refer to it. As of 3/2021, these are:

* _main_ - this repository itself (see `./modules/ROOT/`)
* _awesome-fulcro_ - https://github.com/fulcro-community/awesome-fulcro (as a submodule)
* _guides_ - https://github.com/fulcro-community/guides

= Content contributor guide

Content that should be included in the site by Antora needs to have a [https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/standard-directories/[specific structure] and use correct links.

Antora sees every document source - a github repo, in our case - as a "doc component" and requires that it has a top-level https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/component-version-descriptor/[`antora.yml`] that gives the component a `name` (used in links etc.) and that the Asciidoc content itself is under `modules/<module name>/pages/`. Each module also may have the default `ROOT` module - its name in links etc. is left out (i.e. it is ""). Look at the https://github.com/fulcro-community/guides/[guides] module for an example.

* **Page meta**: The heading of the page must be `h1`, i.e. a single `=`. It will then also be used as the `<title>`. Add `:description: <your text>` right underneath the heading to provide content for the description meta tag and a preview on social media.
* **Links**: https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/navigation/xrefs-and-link-text/[Links to other pages] in the same repository ("doc component"): use `xref:<module name>:<page name>.adoc`. So if you have `modules/my-stuff/pages/index.adoc` you link to it via `xref:my-stuff:index.adoc`. If the module happens to be `ROOT` then leave it out: `xref::<page>`. To link to pages in another "componets", just prefix it with the component's name. Ex.: `xref:guides:guide-learning-fulcro:index.adoc`. See above for available modules.
* **Images**: While pages go to the `pages/` directory of a module, images should be in its `images/` sibling and can be referenced simply by name: `image::my-image.jpg[]`.

= Preview locally

Make sure that you have cloned all relevant fulcro-community repositories (see _Site structure_ above) into the same parent dir and run `./build-locally.sh` to build the site and then a HTTP server to server the resulting directory. 

See `antora-playbook-local.yml` for details.
